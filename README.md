ðŸŒ± About Me

I am currently enrolled in the ALX Frontend Development Program and building the fundamentals needed to become a professional frontend engineer. I am committed to learning clean coding practices, developing a strong debugging mindset, and growing into a developer who creates elegant, user-centered interfaces.

My learning style is visual, structured, and iterative, which means I excel when knowledge is built step by step with real-life connections and hands-on practice.

ðŸ“Œ Learning in Progress (Current Stage)
I am still in the foundations stage of the program, focusing on:

Understanding how frontend development fits into the bigger software ecosystem
Building engineering habits (focus, iteration, debugging thinking, problem-solving)
Learning structured workflows & development environments
Preparing for HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals
This journey is about building a solid base so I can create real-world, impactful projects later on.

ðŸ§­ Roadmap â€” My Growth Path
Foundations (current):
Engineering mindset, structure, environment, problem-solving
HTML & CSS (up next):
Semantic structure, responsive layout, accessibility
JavaScript:
Interactivity, logic, browser APIs
React & frontend architecture:
Components, state, UI patterns
Portfolio & real user-facing projects
Professional specialization later (not locked to a niche yet)
ðŸŽ¯ My Focus Right Now
Becoming consistent with daily practice
Strengthening structured thinking
Building comfort with tools and workflow
Preparing to transition into coding fundamentals
