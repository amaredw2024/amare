ðŸŒ± About Me

I am currently enrolled in the ALX Frontend Development Program and building the fundamentals needed to become a professional frontend engineer. I am committed to learning clean coding practices, developing a strong debugging mindset, and growing into a developer who creates elegant, user-centered interfaces.

My learning style is visual, structured, and iterative, which means I excel when knowledge is built step by step with real-life connections and hands-on practice.

ðŸ“Œ Learning in Progress (Current Stage)
I am still in the foundations stage of the program, focusing on:

Understanding how frontend development fits into the bigger software ecosystem
Building engineering habits (focus, iteration, debugging thinking, problem-solving)
Learning structured workflows & development environments
Preparing for HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals
This journey is about building a solid base so I can create real-world, impactful projects later on.
